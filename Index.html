		<h2>About The Dalek Empire</h2>
		<p> Daleks were a warrior race made up of genetically engineered mutants belonging to fundamental DNA type 467-989. By most accounts they were originally from the planet Skaro. The mutants were encased inside an armoured travel machine built from polycarbide and the metal Dalekanium. </p>

			<li>The Daleks openly acknowledge a single Time Lord, the Doctor, as their greatest enemy.</li>
			<li>The War Doctor said that Daleks were "not robots", but "savage, incredibly intelligent, living, breathing creatures housed inside a war tank". </li>
			<il>Daleks are intensely xenophobic and bent on universal domination, the Daleks were hated and feared throughout time and space.</il>
